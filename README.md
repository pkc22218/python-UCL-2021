# python-UCL-2021

A collection of Python exercises and small projects developed during Year 3 studies at UCL.  
This repository demonstrates key programming skills in problem solving, control flow, file I/O, text processing, and procedural graphics.

üìÇ Repository Overview

dice_game.py: Interactive dice-rolling game with score tracking	Random number generation, loops, input handling
grep.py: Command-line text search utility (grep-like)	File I/O, regex matching, argument parsing
quilt_drawer.py: Generates a colorful quilt-style pattern	Loops, procedural generation, simple graphics
samoan.py: Compact algorithmic and text-processing exercise	String manipulation, functions, logic flow

‚∏ª

üé≤ dice_game.py

Purpose:
A small interactive dice game that demonstrates structured program flow and user interaction.

Features:
	‚Ä¢	Uses Python‚Äôs random module to simulate dice rolls
	‚Ä¢	Tracks scores and rounds through user input
	‚Ä¢	Validates entries and displays results
	‚Ä¢	Ends automatically based on score conditions
  
‚∏ª

üîç grep.py

Purpose:
A simplified version of the Unix grep command that searches for text patterns in files.

Features:
	‚Ä¢	Accepts a search pattern and one or more filenames as arguments
	‚Ä¢	Reads files line-by-line and finds pattern matches
	‚Ä¢	Prints matching lines (optionally with line numbers)
	‚Ä¢	Handles missing or unreadable files gracefully

‚∏ª

üßµ quilt_drawer.py

Purpose:
A procedural drawing exercise that creates a quilt-like geometric pattern using loops and simple drawing commands.

Features:
	‚Ä¢	Draws or prints a grid of repeating patterns using shapes or colors
	‚Ä¢	Uses nested loops to generate the quilt structure
	‚Ä¢	Demonstrates modular drawing functions (draw_tile(), draw_grid())
	‚Ä¢	Can use the turtle graphics library or ASCII output

‚∏ª

‚úçÔ∏è samoan.py

Purpose:
A focused algorithmic and text-processing script that demonstrates concise, readable logic.

Features:
	‚Ä¢	Processes and transforms string or list input
	‚Ä¢	Performs a defined computation or data transformation
	‚Ä¢	Outputs the processed result to the console
