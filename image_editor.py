#Description: this is a program that can operate the below functions on a image in ppm format

#(a) Functionnegative(image_list)
#This function returns a 2D array containing the new image pixels. A negative image contains pixels 
#in which the red, green and blue values have been subtracted from 255. 
#If a pixel value is [255, 34, 100] then the negative pixel will be: [0, 221, 155]. 

#(b) Functionrotate_left_90(image_list)
#In this function you will, as the function name suggests, rotate the image image_list by 90 degrees, 
#rotating it to the left. The source image may have a different width and height as shown in the example below. 

#(c) Functioncrop(image_list,crop_X,crop_Y,crop_width,crop_height)
#This function returns a 2D array containing the image pixels. 
#Cropping an image involves reducing the size of the image so that the top-left pixel of new image is the pixel 
#in the old image with coordinates crop_X and crop_Y. The crop_width and the crop_height are the width and height
#of the new image in pixels.

#(d) Functionblur(image_list)
#In this function you will take an image and implement a blur filter. 
#The algorithm to do this creates a new image in which a pixelâ€™s values are averaged with the values of the 
#immediate neighbours. 
#Pixels at the edge of the image need to be treated slightly differently. In this example, consider the pixel 
#at (1,0). The average has fewer data points and the new pixel generated for the position (1,0) will be:
#red value: (0 + 100 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0) / 6 = 16 green value: (0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 255 + 0) / 6 = 42 
#bluevalue:(0+0+0+0+175+0) / 6=29 pixel value is [16, 42, 29]
